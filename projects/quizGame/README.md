# Python
I am going to build a quiz project. The quiz will have multiple choice questions and some written ones. For now my project is only going to print out the socre in the end.

I just finished my quiz project, I honestly could have optimized it more but I felt like I was getting no where. So I decided to use seperate functions for each question in order to get the input and check it aswell. My next goal with this project is to optimize it with dictionaries or tuples. Although that was my original idea, I decided to do something simple instead.
