# Python 
This project was inspired when me and my cousins had too many people wanting to join our game when we could only play with 4 people. I want this program to take the names of the people currently playing in the party and pick a random person to leave, so that someone else could join and play with us.

I could also add asking the user for how many players they want to put in the lottery
